Framebuffer-less procedural graphics accelerator for a future two-hart RV32I_Zicsr SoC (docs/cpu-contract.md).
Pixels are computed during active scanout instead of stored in SRAM.

Status, 2026-09-25: phases 1 through 3 are done and phase 4 has its first
scene. VGA timing, SMPTE colorbars and the ADV7513 HDMI config walker are
verified in Verilator, and the whole chain has run on real hardware: colorbars
on a monitor off a DE10-Nano, 2026-09-23. The math core, a pipelined CORDIC,
is cross-checked against a Python golden model for all 65536 phases and now
drives a three-grating plasma scene; the current build (D18 DE alignment)
closed timing at worst setup slack +14.012 ns, Slow 1100mV 100C, and ran on
the board 2026-09-25. There is still no RV32 core.

Not done: no RV32 core (contract and ladder in docs/cpu-contract.md), no
interactive demo, no I2S, no SD.

Toolchain (what results are reproduced with):

- Verilator 5.050 for every `make sim*` and `make lint*` target. The CI runner
  uses Ubuntu's apt Verilator, so its exact patch may differ; the numbers quoted
  in the README and docs are measured on 5.050. The sim flow is Verilator-only:
  no Icarus Verilog or Yosys step exists in this repo.
- python3 for the CORDIC golden model (`tb/cordic_golden.py`), which the C++
  testbench reads as its oracle, and for the RV32 assembler and its shared
  encoding tables (`tools/`, with their own golden suites).
- Quartus Prime Standard 25.1 for synthesis, Linux or Windows only. Quartus Pro
  drops the Cyclone V family, so it cannot build this design; Standard needs no
  license for this part.
- A Terasic DE10-Nano (Cyclone V SoC, 5CSEBA6U23I7) to run it on hardware.
  Flashing is optional and covered in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

Reproducing the simulations needs only Verilator and python3: `make sim`,
`sim_i2c`, `sim_config`, `sim_cordic` and `sim_plasma` all run without Quartus
or the board.

## Architecture

<img src="docs/block_diagram.png" alt="Block diagram: board oscillator at 50 MHz into a clock generator whose PLL emits a 25.175 MHz pixel clock, then a timing and prefetch generator feeding a plasma scene built from three parallel CORDIC gratings, through an output mux and pads to the ADV7513 HDMI transmitter and monitor; a config walker on the 50 MHz domain drives an I2C master into the transmitter; a planned 50 MHz CPU path shows an RV32I Zicsr core with hart0 I/D RAM, scene registers crossing by write-then-toggle, an SD loader and a host-side assembler" width="849">

*Solid blue is implemented fabric, dashed is planned per
[docs/cpu-contract.md](docs/cpu-contract.md), green is host tooling. The scene
consumes the prefetch window DEPTH clocks ahead of the beam (plasma 19,
colorbars 1) and its de_o lands on the active window; syncs run from the
timing block to the pads without passing through pixel logic. No framebuffer
exists: a pixel lives for one clock, and scene state is x, y and a frame
counter. Budget: 307,200 active of 420,000 pixel clocks per frame at
25.175 MHz, 18.432 Mpx/s, and the three parallel CORDICs retire one sample
per clock.*

Diagram source is [docs/block_diagram.tex](docs/block_diagram.tex), a
standalone TikZ figure; render it with `tectonic docs/block_diagram.tex` then
`pdftoppm -png -r 200 -singlefile docs/block_diagram.pdf docs/block_diagram`.

## How to read this repo

Start with the status line and the two images below: that is the whole result,
verified in simulation and on the board. For the verification detail, read
[docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md); it lists what each make target
checks and the rules the harnesses follow. For how bugs are found and closed,
read [docs/devlog.md](docs/devlog.md), entries B13 through B19.

<img src="docs/plasma.gif" alt="A boiling plasma pattern in saturated red, green and blue hues, computed per pixel at 640x480" width="640">

*Simulated output: the plasma scene, 60 frames at 640x480 captured from
Verilator (`./obj_dir/sim_plasma +frame=1..60`) and encoded at 20 fps against
a generated 256-color palette with dithering off. The scene uses 29 of the 256
RGB332 codes; all 60 GIF frames are byte-identical to the captures. One frame:
`make sim_plasma` (writes `sim/plasma_frame.ppm`).*

*Simulated output: eight bars at 640x480@60, captured from Verilator to PPM
and converted to PNG (`make sim`). The known-good bring-up reference.*

First bring-up on silicon, 2026-09-23: the same bars on a TV off the
DE10-Nano, through the onboard ADV7513. The phone photo is in the
[v0.1.0 release](https://github.com/avolk201/procedural-gfx-fpga/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

## Evidence and provenance

|---|---|---|---|
| docs/frame.png | 124deeaa3182627197bb532f89333020d5d2192bcecb2faf1958bef5357fccc3 | 5,007 | `make sim` capture, converted with `python3 tb/ppm2png.py` |
| docs/plasma.gif | 5633f894fbd061a484360c5da1cdfe8dfcd3fecccd6b525abaded5128fc6e5f0 | 1,329,888 | 60 Verilator captures (`+frame=1..60`), palette-encoded 20 fps; every frame byte-identical on round-trip (v0.2.0 notes) |
| docs/plasma-bring-up.mp4 | 995ec06c98bd33a7c509af5f57c5f3fe7c85f9d64badaa1a0880501b8da226c9 | 588,044 | phone video, re-encoded 640x360 H.264 30 fps, metadata stripped |
| sim/plasma_frame.ppm | de1ba72984e9b53ca14021e719c7b1a81c3d6a4b5813e31659753a3fa8e775b7 | 921,615 | `make sim_plasma` one-frame capture; the B18 control hash, re-run 2026-09-28 and equal |

The media metadata was stripped on purpose (privacy), which also removes
capture time and device. The hashes above plus the dated devlog entries are
what carry provenance; the v0.1.0 phone photo lives in the release assets,
its EXIF stripped too.

What was not measured, stated as absence:
- Monitor model (2026-09-23) and OLED model (2026-09-25) are unrecorded.
- No oscilloscope capture of pixel clock or syncs; timing evidence is the
  counter measurements in `make sim` plus a picture on a live display.
- No logic-analyzer capture of the physical I2C bus; wire-level claims come
  from sim_i2c's closed-loop model, and the hardware evidence is the
  ADV7513 ACKing all 13 writes (devlog bring-up, 2026-09-23).
- No ADV7513 register readback; the walker is write-only by design.
- Endurance unmeasured; longest continuous run is not logged.
- Hot-plug after configuration untested; only the power-up HPD ordering
  claim is established (B15).

## Where this is going

1. Math core: pipelined CORDIC against a Python golden model. Done and
   cross-checked ([docs/cordic.md](docs/cordic.md) has the convergence and
   bit-width argument); it now drives the plasma scene at the top.
2. Real scenes: the plasma is in; next is a DDA raycaster with textures.
3. The namesake: own RV32 core and assembler, memory-mapped scene registers.
   The assembler, encoding tables, the two-hart ISS and the sweep goldens
   are in (`tools/`); the two-hart core is next, contract first
   ([docs/cpu-contract.md](docs/cpu-contract.md)).
4. Storage: SPI SD card with a flat container format, the cartridge.
5. Games: an interactive raycaster demo, then small original games.

Every phase ships a contract doc, a golden model and a self-checking
testbench that has been seen fail at least once. Nothing lands on vibes.
